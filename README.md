The daily quote plugin for glFusion offers a way to display random quotations on your site.
Quotes may be displayed in a block or within content by using an autotag, such as
- [dailyquote:quote 2016112816450351] - Display a specific quote. Quote ID is required.
- [dailyquote:random cat:2] - Get a random quote, optionally within a given category.
Adding "source" to either autotag will include the source of the quote.
